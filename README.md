Formatting output
===========================================================

In this challenge you are to display the provided data in a nicely formatted table.

There are 3 structures provided. Yes, these could also be classes with public data, 
but it's common to use structures when we simply want to model only data and not 
operations as we would with classes.

The structures work together to create a Tours structure that will contain
information about Tours to South America.
The Tours include Countries, Cities within those countries along with population and cost data for 
each city tour.
I know, population? Huh? I just wanted a big number so that you can format it, OK :)

Please watch the solution for the expected output. It won't look right if I put it in this
editor because of the font style.

In the provided source code I'm giving you some code that displays the data from the structures 
and the vectors within the structures. This code uses tabs to format the data and it looks pretty ugly.
