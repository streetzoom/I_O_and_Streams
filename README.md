Formatting output
===========================================================

In this challenge you are to display the provided data in a nicely formatted table.

There are 3 structures provided. Yes, these could also be classes with public data, 
but it's common to use structures when we simply want to model only data and not 
operations as we would with classes.

The structures work together to create a Tours structure that will contain
information about Tours to South America.
The Tours include Countries, Cities within those countries along with population and cost data for 
each city tour.
I know, population? Huh? I just wanted a big number so that you can format it, OK :)

Please watch the Challenge video for the expected output. It won't look right if I put it in this
editor because of the font style.


Country        City                Population          Price
============================================================
Colombia       Bogota                 8778000         400.98
Colombia       Cali                   2401000         424.12
Colombia       Medellin               2464000         350.98
Colombia       Cartagena               972000         345.34

Brazil         Rio De Janiero        13500000         567.45
Brazil         Sao Paulo             11310000         975.45
Brazil         Salvador              18234000         855.99

Chile          Valdivia                260000         569.12
Chile          Santiago               7040000            520

Argentina      Buenos Aires           3010000         723.77

In the provided source code I'm giving you some code that displays the data from the structures 
and the vectors within the structures. This code uses tabs to format the data and it looks pretty ugly.
